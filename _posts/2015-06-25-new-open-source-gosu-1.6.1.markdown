The Gosu team is happy to announce the official release of Gosu 1.6.1

The focus of this release was mainly to support Java 8, Gosu now compiles with the latest JDK 8.
A ton of work went into this release:

- full support of Java 8. 
- new features added to the language to play nice with Java 8. Please have a look at our new blog [post]({{ site.url }}/2015/06/25/gosu-java8.html) for more information. 
- Gosu now supports checked arithmetic, find more about it [here]({{ site.url }}/2015/06/25/checked-arithmetic.html).
- we are now deploying our jars directly on [Maven central](http://search.maven.org/).
- many bug fixes.
 
Stay tuned for the next release, it will include a brand new IntelliJ 14 plugin.
