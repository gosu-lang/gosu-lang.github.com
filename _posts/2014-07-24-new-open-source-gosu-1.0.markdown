title: New Open Source Gosu 1.1
author: Gosu Team

The Gosu team is happy to announce the official release of Gosu 1.1!

The 1.x releases mark a big step forward in our open source commitment.
In the past the main development of Gosu happened internally at Guidewire, with sporadic open source releases. Today we have switched completely our development into the
open: there is a single [repository](https://github.com/gosu-lang/gosu-lang) for the language.

Please feel free to file issues and pull requests, we are glad to receive external contributions.
